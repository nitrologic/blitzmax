# It is generally recommended NOT to have a bbcc.conf file in the same folder as
# your bcc binary.
#
# However, when debugging bcc, usually your debugger has a different BMXPATH to
# that of the bcc you are debugging. This can cause problems, like accessing
# modules from the debugger's BlitzMax rather than those of the bcc you are
# debugging.
# You can override the BMXPATH environment variable inherited from your debugger
# by copying this file as "bbc.conf" next to your bcc-binary and uncomment
# the following lines, adjusting the path accordingly :
#
#BMXPATH=YOUR/PATH/TO/BLITZMAX
